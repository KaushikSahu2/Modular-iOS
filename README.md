# Sample Project
This project is a demo to create a modular architecture with Multi Framework approach using factory pattern.

To explore the project just open **MyFirstModule.xcworkspace**.

## What's inside
The workspace has several sub projects:

**App** contains the main app bundle.  
**Modules** contains two distinct sets of feature: _Chat_ and _UserProfile_.  
**Service** and Utils contain things shared by all the features.  
**Dependendencies** is where you'll find the public protocol for all modules.

Thank you!
